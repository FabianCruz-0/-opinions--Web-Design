                    I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned
                    were current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I
                    honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.

                     “ I was an EMT for many
                    years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
                    transition and have heard some people who had an amazing
                    experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found
                    it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
                    weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
                    completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers,
                    working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

                  “ Before
                  joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I needed
                  some structure from professionals who can help me learn
                  programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                  student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
                  program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They
                  were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance.
                  The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my
                  learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever
                  have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an
                  example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a
                  job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers.
                  100% recommend! ”
